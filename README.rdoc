=== Purpose
This was created as a prototype for a political timeline app, focused on the 2016 Presidential Elections. While the specifics of what a candidate says are always important, oftentimes knowing the topics they are talking about, and how often, is also telling. This app would display a timeline for candidates, showing the issues they're publicly addressing, and when. Users could view timelines for one specific candidate, or choose to compare timelines so they could see when someone might be reacting to another candidate's words.

=== Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Run `bundle install` from inside the app in your terminal
3. Run `rake db: create` and `rake db:migrate`, followed by `rake db:seed` if you wish to use the seed file
4. Run `rails server` then go to localhost:3000 in your browser

=== User Stories
Our User Stories can be found here: https://trello.com/b/DvuoBMqh/candidate-timeline

These User Stories helped us define what the app needed to do and in which order to build those important aspects that we could in the short time we had to work on it.

=== Functions
The homepage allows you to choose by candidate or topic, and to see the overall index pages for candidate and topic. Each candidate page features information on the candidate and curated articles sorted by topic. It is also possible, from the articles index, to search a database of articles for ones that are not readily available from the app. Logging in and saving a session is also possible.
